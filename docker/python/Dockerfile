#   * ca-certificates: for SSL verification during Pip and easy_install
#   * python: the binaries themselves
#   * py-setuptools: required only in major version 2, installs easy_install so we can install Pip.

# These packages are not installed immediately, but are added at runtime or ONBUILD to shrink the image as much as possible. Notes:
#   * build-base: used so we include the basic development packages (gcc)
#   * linux-headers: commonly needed, and an unusual package name from Alpine.
#   * python-dev: are used for gevent e.g.
#   * py-pip: provides pip, not needed once the software is built

# This script installs APK and Pip prerequisites on container start, or ONBUILD. Notes:
#   * Reads the -a flags and /apk-requirements.txt for install requests
#   * Reads the -b flags and /build-requirements.txt for build packages -- removed when build is complete
#   * Reads the -p flags and /requirements.txt for Pip packages
#   * Reads the -r flag to specify a different file path for /requirements.txt
